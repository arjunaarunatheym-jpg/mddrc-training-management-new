# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎉 PHASE 1 BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - All participant test-taking endpoints working perfectly! Comprehensive testing completed with 25/25 tests passed. Fixed critical Pydantic model attribute access issue in get_available_tests endpoint. Validated complete test flow: participant login → available tests retrieval → test submission → detailed results access. All security controls working: 403 for non-participants, correct answer filtering, access restrictions. Both new endpoints (GET /sessions/{id}/tests/available and GET /tests/results/{id}) are production-ready with full functionality and security validation."

    message: "User requested two additions: 1) Delete functionality for sessions (admin was unable to delete sessions), 2) Clarification on test management location. Added DELETE /api/sessions/{session_id} endpoint with admin auth and cascade delete of participant_access records. Updated AdminDashboard Sessions tab with Delete button. Test management already accessible via Programs tab → click 'Tests' button on any program. Ready for testing."

    message: "🔍 URGENT CERTIFICATE DEBUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - FOUND AND FIXED FRONTEND ISSUE! Investigated specific user maaman@gmail.com certificate download problem. ✅ Backend Analysis: All backend functionality working perfectly - user login successful, has 1 session, completed all requirements (pre-test ✓, post-test ✓, feedback ✓), certificate generation working, both download methods functional. ❌ Frontend Issue Identified: ParticipantDashboard.jsx using window.open() for certificate downloads, but window.open() doesn't include Authorization header from axiosInstance. ✅ Frontend Fix Applied: Modified handleDownloadCertificate() to use direct certificate_url (no auth required) as primary method, with authenticated blob download as fallback. Added handleDownloadExistingCertificate() function and download buttons to certificates tab. Root cause: Authentication header missing in window.open() calls. Solution: Use direct file URLs or authenticated blob downloads."

Implemented new backend endpoint GET /api/certificates/preview/{certificate_id} that returns the .docx file with inline content-disposition for browser preview. Updated ParticipantDashboard.jsx with Preview buttons (blue with Eye icon) alongside Download buttons in both Overview and Certificates tabs. Preview uses authenticated blob download to handle authorization, creates blob URL and opens in new tab. Download functionality remains unchanged and working. Both features now available to participants. Ready for backend and frontend testing."

    message: "🎉 BUG FIX TESTING COMPLETE - ALL 3 BUG FIXES WORKING PERFECTLY! Comprehensive testing completed with 6/6 tests passed (0 failures). Created bug_fix_test.py to test all three priority bug fixes. ✅ PRIORITY 1 - Trainer Assignment Bug Fix (3/3 tests passed): Tested with 6, 10, and 15 participants. All participants correctly assigned with proper 30/70 distribution between chief and regular trainers. No missing participants in any scenario. ✅ PRIORITY 2 - Post-Test Review Question Order Fix (2/2 tests passed): Post-test with shuffled question_indices [2,0,4,1,3] correctly stores indices and reorders questions in review to match participant's view. Pre-test without question_indices maintains original order (backwards compatible). ✅ PRIORITY 3 - Certificate Template Placeholder (1/1 test passed): Certificate generation endpoint working correctly with new '<<PROGRAMME NAME>>' placeholder support. All bug fixes are production-ready and fully functional."
